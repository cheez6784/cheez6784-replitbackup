    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>I respect your privacy in every way. This website uses cookies to track 2 things. The name of the bot that you have set, and your emotion rating. All other things are not stored in any other way. Items are stored with python Flask's session. I do not look at or store anything like your nearest server location, IP, or anything else. Unless you contribute your answers, your answers are not saved. Just processed, and removed. If you have any issues with these, the bot cannot work without these basic permissions.</p>
